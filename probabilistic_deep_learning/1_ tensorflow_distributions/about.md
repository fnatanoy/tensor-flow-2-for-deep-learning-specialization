# TensorFlow Distributions

Probabilistic modelling is a powerful and principled approach that provides a framework in which to take account of uncertainty in the data. The TensorFlow Probability (TFP) library provides tools for developing probabilistic models that extend the capability of TensorFlow. In this first week of the course, you will learn how to use the Distribution objects in TFP, and the key methods to sample from and compute probabilities from these distributions. You will also learn how to make these distributions trainable. The programming assignment or this week will put these techniques into practice by implementing a Naive Bayes classifier on the Iris dataset.
