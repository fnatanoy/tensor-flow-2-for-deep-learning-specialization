# Probabilistic Layers and Bayesian Neural Networks

Accounting for sources of uncertainty is an important aspect of the modelling process, especially for safety-critical applications such as medical diagnoses. Most standard deep learning models do not quantify the uncertainty in their predictions. In this week you will learn how to use probabilistic layers from TensorFlow Probability to develop deep learning models that are able to provide measures of uncertainty in both the data, and the model itself. In the programming assignment for this week, you will develop a Bayesian CNN for the MNIST and MNIST-C datasets.
