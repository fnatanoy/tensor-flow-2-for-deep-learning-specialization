# Bijectors and Normalising Flows

Normalising flows are a powerful class of generative models, that aim to model the underlying data distribution by transforming a simple base distribution through a series of bijective transformations. In this week you will learn how to use bijector objects from the TensorFlow Probability library to implement these transformations, and learn a complex transformed distribution from data. These models can be used to sample new data generations, as well as evaluate the likelihood of data examples. In the programming assignment for this week, you will develop a RealNVP normalising flow model for the LSUN bedroom dataset.
